# Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks discussing various topics of Digital Signal Processing. 

## The Jupyter notebooks are available:

* Online as [static web pages](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hkortier/DSP/blob/master/index.ipynb).
* Online for [interactive use](http://mybinder.org/repo/hkortier/DSP) using [binder](http://mybinder.org/). This will not always be up-to-date.
* Local (offline but faster than binder) use on your computer. I recommend using the [Anaconda software package](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

For local use on your computer you need a local Jupyter/IPython installation. The Anaconda distribtution provides a good starting point. You have to clone/download the notebooks from Github. Use a Git client to clone the notebooks and then start your local Jupyter server. For manual installation under OS X/Linux please refer to your packet manager.
